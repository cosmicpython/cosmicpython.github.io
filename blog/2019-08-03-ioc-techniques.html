  <div class="content">
    <p><em>David was a tech reviewer for the <a href="/">book</a> and these two excellent
articles on inversion of control are cross-posted from
<a href="https://seddonym.me/blog/">his blog where you can find lots more excellent content</a>.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="/blog/2019-04-15-inversion-of-control.html">the previous post</a> we learned how Inversion of Control can
be visualised as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/a-b-plugin.png" alt="B plugging into A"></p>
<p><code>B</code> plugs into <code>A</code>.  <code>A</code> provides a mechanism for <code>B</code> to do this &mdash; but otherwise <code>A</code> need know nothing about <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>The diagram provides a high level view of the mechanism, but how is this actually implemented?</p>
<h2>A pattern for inverting control</h2>
<p>Getting a little closer to the code structure, we can use this powerful pattern:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/di-pattern.png" alt="main pointing to A and B, A pointing to &lt;B&gt;, B pointing (open arrow) to &lt;B&gt;"></p>
<p>This is the basic shape of inversion of control. Captured within the notation, which may or may not be familiar
to you, are the concepts of <em>abstraction</em>, <em>implementation</em> and <em>interface</em>. These concepts are all important
to understanding the techniques we&rsquo;ll be employing. Let&rsquo;s make sure we understand what they mean when applied
to Python.</p>
<h3>Abstractions, implementations and interfaces &mdash; in Python</h3>
<p>Consider three Python classes:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Animal</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="ne">NotImplementedError</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Cat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Animal</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Meow.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Dog</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Animal</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Woof.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this example, <code>Animal</code> is an <em>abstraction</em>: it declares its <code>speak</code> method, but it&rsquo;s not intended to be run (as
is signalled by the <code>NotImplementedError</code>).</p>
<p><code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code>, however, are <em>implementations</em>: they both implement the <code>speak</code> method, each in their own way.</p>
<p>The <code>speak</code> method can be thought of as an <em>interface</em>: a common way in which other code may interact with
these classes.</p>
<p>This relationship of classes is often drawn like this, with an open arrow indicating that <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code> are concrete
implementations of <code>Animal</code>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/animal-cat-dog.png" alt="Diagram of Cat and Dog subclassing Animal" /></p>
<h4>Polymorphism and duck typing</h4>
<p>Because <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code> implement a shared interface, we can interact with either class without knowing which one it is:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">make_animal_speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">animal</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">animal</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">speak</span><span class="p">()</span>


<span class="n">make_animal_speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Cat</span><span class="p">())</span>
<span class="n">make_animal_speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Dog</span><span class="p">())</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>make_animal_speak</code> function need not know anything about cats or dogs; all it has to know is how to interact
with the abstract concept of an animal. Interacting with objects without knowing
their specific type, only their interface, is known as &lsquo;polymorphism&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Of course, in Python we don&rsquo;t actually <em>need</em> the base class:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Cat</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Meow.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Dog</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">speak</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Woof.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Even if <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code> don&rsquo;t inherit <code>Animal</code>, they can still be passed to <code>make_animal_speak</code> and things
will work just fine. This informal ability to interact with an object without it explicitly declaring an interface
is known as &lsquo;duck typing&rsquo;.</p>
<p>We aren&rsquo;t limited to classes; functions may also be used in this way:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">notify_by_email</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">customer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">notify_by_text_message</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">customer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>


<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">notify</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">notify_by_email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">notify_by_text_message</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">notify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">customer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We may even use Python modules:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">email</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">text_message</span>


<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">notification_method</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">email</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">text_message</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">notification_method</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">notify</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">customer</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">event</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Whether a shared interface is manifested in a formal, object oriented manner, or more implicitly, we can
generalise the separation between the interface and the implementation like so:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/interface-implementation.png" alt="Diagram of implementation inheriting abstract interface" /></p>
<p>This separation will give us a lot of power, as we&rsquo;ll see now.</p>
<h2>A second look at the pattern</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look again at the Inversion of Control pattern.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/di-pattern.png" alt="main pointing to A and B, A pointing to &lt;B&gt;, B pointing (open arrow) to &lt;B&gt;" /></p>
<p>In order to invert control between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, we&rsquo;ve added two things to our design.</p>
<p>The first is <code>&lt;&lt;B&gt;&gt;</code>. We&rsquo;ve separated out into its abstraction (which <code>A</code> will continue to depend on and know about),
from its implementation (of which <code>A</code> is blissfully ignorant).</p>
<p>However, somehow the software will need to make sure that <code>B</code> is used in place of its abstraction. We therefore need
some orchestration code that knows about both <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, and does the final linking of them together. I&rsquo;ve called
this <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now time to look at the techniques we may use for doing this.</p>
<h2>Technique One: Dependency Injection</h2>
<p>Dependency Injection is where a piece of code allows the calling code to control its dependencies.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the following function, which doesn&rsquo;t yet support dependency injection:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># hello_world.py</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, world.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This function is called from a top level function like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># main.py</span>

<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">hello_world</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">hello_world</span>


<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>hello_world</code> has one dependency that is of interest to us: the built in function <code>print</code>. We can draw a diagram
of these dependencies like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/main-hw-print.png" alt="Main pointing to hello_world pointing to print" /></p>
<p>The first step is to identify the abstraction that  <code>print</code> implements. We could think of this simply as a
function that outputs a message it is supplied &mdash; let&rsquo;s call it <code>output_function</code>.</p>
<p>Now, we adjust <code>hello_world</code> so it supports the injection of the implementation of <code>output_function</code>.  Drum roll please&hellip;</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># hello_world.py</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output_function</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">output_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, world.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All we do is allow it to receive the output function as an argument. The orchestration code then passes in the <code>print</code> function via the argument:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># main.py</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hello_world</span>


<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">output_function</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. It couldn&rsquo;t get much simpler, could it? In this example, we&rsquo;re injecting a callable, but other
implementations could expect a class, an instance or even a module.</p>
<p>With very little code, we have moved the dependency out of <code>hello_world</code>, into the top level function:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/main-hw-print-output.png" alt="Main pointing to hello_world and print, hello_world pointing to &lt;output&gt;, print pointing (open arrow) to &lt;output&gt;." /></p>
<p>Notice that although there isn&rsquo;t a formally declared abstract <code>output_function</code>, that concept is implicitly there, so
I&rsquo;ve included it in the diagram.</p>
<h2>Technique Two: Registry</h2>
<p>A <em>Registry</em> is a store that one piece of code reads from to decide how to behave, which may be
written to by other parts of the system. Registries require a bit more machinery that dependency injection.</p>
<p>They take two forms: <em>Configuration</em> and <em>Subscriber</em>:</p>
<h3>The Configuration Registry</h3>
<p>A configuration registry gets populated once, and only once. A piece of code uses one
to allow its behaviour to be configured from outside.</p>
<p>Although this needs more machinery than dependency injection, it doesn&rsquo;t need much:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># hello_world.py</span>


<span class="n">config</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{}</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">output_function</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;OUTPUT_FUNCTION&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
    <span class="n">output_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, world.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To complete the picture, here&rsquo;s how it could be configured externally:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># main.py</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hello_world</span>


<span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;OUTPUT_FUNCTION&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">print</span>


<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The machinery in this case is simply a dictionary that is written to from outside the module. In a real world system,
we might want a slightly more sophisticated config system (making it immutable for example, is a good idea). But at heart,
any key-value store will do.</p>
<p>As with dependency injection, the output function&rsquo;s implementation has been lifted out, so <code>hello_world</code> no longer depends on it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/configuration-registry.png" alt="Configuration registry" /></p>
<h3>The Subscriber Registry</h3>
<p>In contrast to a configuration registry, which should only be populated once, a
subscriber registry may be populated an arbitrary number of times by different parts
of the system.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s develop our ultra-trivial example to use this pattern. Instead of saying &ldquo;Hello, world&rdquo;, we want
to greet an arbitrary number of people: &ldquo;Hello, John.&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hello, Martha.&rdquo;, etc. Other parts of the system should be
able to add people to the list of those we should greet.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># hello_people.py</span>

<span class="n">people</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_people</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">person</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">people</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">f</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="n">person</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># john.py</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hello_people</span>


<span class="n">hello_people</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">people</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;John&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># martha.py</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hello_people</span>


<span class="n">hello_people</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">people</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Martha&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As with the configuration registry, there is a store that can be written to from outside. But instead of
being a dictionary, it&rsquo;s a list. This list is populated, typically
at startup, by other components scattered throughout the system. When the time is right,
the code works through each item one by one.</p>
<p>A diagram of this system would be:</p>
<p><img src="/images/ioc-techniques/subscriber-registry.png" alt="Subscriber registry" /></p>
<p>Notice that in this case, <code>main</code> doesn&rsquo;t need to know about the registry &mdash; instead, it&rsquo;s the subscribers elsewhere
in the system that write to it.</p>
<h4>Subscribing to events</h4>
<p>A common reason for using a subscriber registry is to allow other parts of a system to react to events
that happen one place, without that place directly calling them. This is often solved by the <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/observer">Observer Pattern</a>,
a.k.a. pub/sub.</p>
<p>We may implement this in much the same way as above, except instead of adding strings to a list, we add callables:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># hello_world.py</span>

<span class="n">subscribers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello_world</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, world.&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">subscriber</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">subscribers</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">subscriber</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># log.py</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hello_world</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">write_to_log</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>


<span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">subscribers</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">write_to_log</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Technique Three: Monkey Patching</h2>
<p>Our final technique, <em>Monkey Patching</em>, is very different to the others, as it doesn&rsquo;t use the Inversion of Control
pattern described above.</p>
<p>If our <code>hello_world</code> function doesn&rsquo;t implement any hooks for injecting its output function, we <em>could</em> monkey patch the
built in <code>print</code> function with something different:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># main.py</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">hello_world</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">print_twice</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">print_twice</span>


<span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">print</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">print_twice</span>


<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hello_world</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Monkey patching takes other forms. You could manipulate to your heart&rsquo;s content some hapless class defined elsewhere
&mdash; changing attributes, swapping in other methods, and generally doing whatever you like to it.</p>
<h2>Choosing a technique</h2>
<p>Given these three techniques, which should you choose, and when?</p>
<h3>When to use monkey patching</h3>
<p>Code that abuses the Python&rsquo;s dynamic power can be extremely
difficult to understand or maintain. The problem is that if you are reading monkey patched code, you have no clue
to tell you that it is being manipulated elsewhere.</p>
<p>Monkey patching should be reserved for desperate times, where you don&rsquo;t have the ability to change the code you&rsquo;re
patching, and it&rsquo;s really, truly impractical to do anything else.</p>
<p>Instead of monkey patching, it&rsquo;s much better to use one of the other inversion of control techniques.
These expose an API that formally provides the hooks that other code can use to change behaviour, which is easier
to reason about and predict.</p>
<p>A legitimate exception is testing, where you can make use of <code>unittest.mock.patch</code>. This <em>is</em> monkey patching, but it&rsquo;s
a pragmatic way to manipulate dependencies when testing code. Even then, some people view testing like this as
a code smell.</p>
<h3>When to use dependency injection</h3>
<p>If your dependencies change at runtime, you&rsquo;ll need dependency injection. Its alternative, the registry,
is best kept immutable. You don&rsquo;t want to be changing what&rsquo;s in a registry, except at application start up.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html"><code>json.dumps</code></a> is a good example from the standard library which uses
dependency injection. It serializes a Python object to a JSON string, but if the default encoding doesn&rsquo;t support what
you&rsquo;re trying to serialize, it allows you to pass in a custom encoder class.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t need dependencies to change, dependency injection is a good technique if you want a really simple way
of overriding dependencies, and don&rsquo;t want the extra machinery of configuration.</p>
<p>However, if you are having to inject the same dependency a lot, you might find your code becomes rather unwieldy and
repetitive. This can also happen if you only need the dependency quite deep in the call stack, and are having to pass
it around a lot of functions.</p>
<h3>When to use registries</h3>
<p>Registries are a good choice if the dependency can be fixed at start up time. While you could use dependency injection
instead, the registry is a good way to keep configuration separate from the control flow code.</p>
<p>Use a configuration registry when you need something configured to a single value. If there is already a
configuration system in place (e.g. if you&rsquo;re using a framework that has a way of providing global configuration) then
there&rsquo;s even less extra machinery to set up. A good example of this is Django&rsquo;s ORM, which provides a Python API around different database engines. The ORM does not depend on any one database engine; instead,
you <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/settings/#databases">configure your project to use a particular database engine</a>
via Django&rsquo;s configuration system.  </p>
<p>Use a subscriber registry for pub/sub, or when you depend on an arbitrary number of values. Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/signals/">signals</a>,
which are a pub/sub mechanism, use this pattern. A rather different use case, also from Django,
is its <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/">admin site</a>. This uses a subscriber registry to
allow different database tables to be registered with it, exposing a CRUD interface in the UI.</p>
<p>Configuration registries <em>may</em> be used in place of subscriber registries for configuring,
say, a list &mdash; if you prefer doing your linking up in single place, rather than scattering it throughout the application.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope these examples, which were as simple as I could think of, have shown how easy it is to invert control in Python.
While it&rsquo;s not always the most obvious way to structure things, it can be achieved with very little extra code.</p>
<p>In the real world, you may prefer to employ these techniques with a bit more structure. I often choose classes rather
than functions as the swappable dependencies, as they allow you to declare the interface in a more formal way.
Dependency injection, too, has more sophisticated implementations, and there are even some third party frameworks available.</p>
<p>There are costs as well as benefits. Locally, code that employs IoC may be harder to understand and debug, so be sure that it
is reducing complication overall.</p>
<p>Whichever approaches you take, the important thing to remember is that the relationship of dependencies in a software package is
crucial to how easy it will be to understand and change. Following the path of least resistance can result in dependencies
being structured in ways that are, in fact, unnecessarily difficult to work with. These techniques give you the power
to invert dependencies where appropriate, allowing you to create more maintainable, modular code. Use them wisely!</p>
