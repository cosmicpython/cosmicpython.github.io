  <h1>Colophon</h1>

<p>The animal on the cover of <em>Architecture Patterns with Python</em> is a Burmese python (<em>Python bivitattus</em>). As you might expect, the Burmese python is native to Southeast Asia. Today it lives in jungles and marshes in South Asia, Myanmar, China, and Indonesia; it’s also invasive in Florida’s Everglades.</p>

<p>Burmese pythons are one of the world’s largest species of snakes. These nocturnal, carnivorous constrictors can grow to 23 feet and 200 pounds. Females are larger than males. They can lay up to a hundred eggs in one clutch. In the wild, Burmese pythons live an average of 20 to 25 years.</p>

<p>The markings on a Burmese python begin with an arrow-shaped spot of light brown on top of the head and continue along the body in rectangles that stand out against its otherwise tan scales. Before they reach their full size, which takes two to three years, Burmese pythons live in trees hunting small mammals and birds. They also swim for long stretches of time—going up to 30 minutes without air.</p>

<p>Because of habitat destruction, the Burmese python has a conservation status of Vulnerable. Many of the animals on O’Reilly’s covers are endangered; all of them are important to the world.</p>
