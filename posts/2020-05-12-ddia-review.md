I bought this book on the strength of its reviews, and I am very happy to add
my own to the long list of five-stars.

The book's aim is to help people to choose the right database technology for
their problem. It does so by explaining, at quite a decent level of detail:

* How various databases, algorithms and data structures work.
* What guarantees they can give and what they cannot.
* Examples of edge cases and unexpected behaviours.

It certainly has the potential to be _unbelievably_ dry.  But there are two
things, I think, that mean it actually turns out to be quite a page-turner The
first is if the reader is actually interested in the subject matter.
I certainly was; it filled a lot of gaps in my knowledge.  But the second is
the quality of the writing.  Somehow Kleppmann manages to give the whole thing
the feeling of the old [“but wait, there’s more!”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqW_6amFMHM)
comedy sketch trope.

Each chapter starts with a problem (eg “how do we manage concurrent access to
the database?” and then presents some seemingly straightforward solutions
(“transactions!”), then it goes on to explain them in detail, and along the way
we learn all sorts of horrible gotchas, and new, thornier, more subtle problems
that have been thrown up.  And that leads us on to the next chapter, like an
unbelievably nerdy cliffhanger.  I couldn't put it down.

It’s really well balanced between academic and practical engineering concerns,
it’s extensively footnoted, it’s really well explained with good examples, and
it ends on a thoughtful, philosophical note.  If any of this sounds appealing
at all, go read it no!

Plus he’s quite a fan of the event-driven approach ;-)
