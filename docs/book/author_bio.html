  <h1>About the Authors</h1>
  <p><strong>Harry Percival</strong> spent a few years being deeply unhappy as a management consultant. Soon he rediscovered his true geek nature and was lucky enough to fall in with a bunch of XP fanatics, working on pioneering the sadly defunct Resolver One spreadsheet. He worked at PythonAnywhere LLP, spreading the gospel of TDD worldwide at talks, workshops, and conferences. He is now with MADE.com.</p>

  <p><strong>Bob Gregory</strong> is a UK-based software architect with MADE.com. He has been building event-driven systems with domain-driven design for more than a decade.</p>
